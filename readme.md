Game Table | A suite of ways to choose a board game     |

  Game Table is a simple application that uses the API from boardgamegeek.com to
help users choose what game to play on a given night.

  Given a BGG username the user's collection can be filtered down by player count,
duration, and genre. The app then helps the users choose one game to play using
a number of possible methods:

- Random: Picks a random game from the list.
- Nominate-Random: Users nominate games and then a random one is chosen.
- Eliminate: Users take turns removing games from the list until only one game remains.
- Vote: Users nominate games and then vote on them. Most votes wins.
- Nominate-Rank: Users nominate games and then vote on them in a series of votes
    which increase in value.
- Bracket: Users choose between two games at a time until only one game remains.

  Game Table was built by Matt Grosso (mattgrosso@gmail.com) as his final project
for the front-end engineering class at The Iron Yard, DC. Enjoy!
