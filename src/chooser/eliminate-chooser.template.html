  In this method, you simply take turns eliminating games from the list (one at a time or else multiples; that's up to you) until only one game remains on the list.

<ul ng-hide="eliminate.downToOne">
  <li ng-repeat="game in eliminate.collection">
    {{game.name}}
    <button ng-click="eliminate.eliminateGame(game)" type="button">X</button>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 ng-show="eliminate.downToOne">{{eliminate.collection[0].name}}</h2>
